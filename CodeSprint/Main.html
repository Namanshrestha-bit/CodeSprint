            <p>
                CodeSprint is a platform created by the KodeClub for the students of RGIPT. Our mission is to bring together all the best coding questions from GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and more, onto a single website. Here, RGIPT students can practice, solve problems, and in the future, maintain their own coding profiles.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>This is just the beginning! Soon, you'll be able to track your progress, compete with peers, and grow as a coder—all in one place.</em>
